In this article, we will give you some tips and tricks on how to play Championship Manager 2007.
 
### Career Mode
 
In Career Mode, you can start from scratch or take over an existing club. You can set your own objectives and budgets, and manage every aspect of your club, such as transfers, tactics, training, staff, finances, media, and more. You can also interact with your players and board, and deal with various situations that may arise during the season. Here are some tips for Career Mode:

- Do your research before signing players. Use the scout reports, player profiles, and statistics to find the best players for your team. You can also use filters and shortlists to narrow down your search.
- Be realistic with your expectations. Don't expect to win every game or sign every player you want. You have to deal with competition, injuries, suspensions, morale, form, and other factors that may affect your performance.
- Plan ahead for the future. Don't spend all your money on expensive players who may decline or retire soon. Invest in young talents who have high potential and can develop into stars. You can also use the youth academy and feeder clubs to find new prospects.
- Be flexible with your tactics. Don't stick to one formation or style of play. Adapt to your opponents and situations. You can use the tactic creator to design your own tactics, or use the preset ones. You can also make changes during the game using the match screen.
- Keep an eye on your staff. Your staff can help you with various tasks, such as scouting, coaching, physiotherapy, etc. Hire the best staff you can afford, and assign them to their roles. You can also delegate some responsibilities to them if you want.

### Challenge Mode
 
In Challenge Mode, you can test your skills in various scenarios that are based on real-life events. You can choose from different difficulties and time limits, and try to achieve the objectives given to you. Some of the challenges are:

- The Great Escape: You take over a team that is in danger of relegation with only a few games left. Can you save them from the drop?
- The Invincibles: You take over a team that is unbeaten in the league so far. Can you maintain their record until the end of the season?
- The Treble: You take over a team that is still in contention for three major trophies. Can you win them all?
- The Underdogs: You take over a team that is expected to lose against a much stronger opponent. Can you pull off a shock result?
- The Sack Race: You take over a team that is performing poorly under their previous manager. Can you turn things around before you get sacked?

### Battle Mode
 
In Battle Mode, you can compete against other players online or offline in a series of matches. You can choose from different formats and rules, such as knockout, league, cup, etc. You can also customize your own tournaments and invite your friends to join. Here are some tips for Battle Mode:

- Choose your team wisely. Depending on the format and rules of the tournament, you may have to use different teams for different matches. Pick the teams that suit your style and strategy.
- Prepare for your opponents. Before each match, you can see your opponent's profile and statistics. Use this information to plan your tactics and counter their strengths and weaknesses.
- Use your power-ups. During each match, you can use power-ups to boost your team or hinder your opponent's team. Power-ups include extra time, extra subs, red cards, injuries, etc. Use them wisely and strategically.
