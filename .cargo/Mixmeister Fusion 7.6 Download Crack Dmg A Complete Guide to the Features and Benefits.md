Mixmeister Fusion supports a wide range of MIDI controllers, such as Numark Mixtrack Pro, Akai APC40, Behringer BCD3000, and more.
 
Another feature that sets Mixmeister Fusion apart from other DJ software is its ability to mix songs harmonically. This means that you can blend songs that are in the same or compatible musical keys, creating smooth and seamless transitions. Mixmeister Fusion uses a keycode system that analyzes the key of each song and assigns it a number and a color. You can then use the key wheel to find songs that match or complement each other. You can also adjust the key of any song using the key knob.
 
If you want to add some spice to your mixes, you can use the VST effects that come with Mixmeister Fusion. You can apply effects to individual tracks or to the master output. You can also automate the effects parameters using envelopes or MIDI controllers. Mixmeister Fusion includes a variety of effects, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, filter, and more. You can also use third-party VST plugins if you want to expand your sonic palette.
