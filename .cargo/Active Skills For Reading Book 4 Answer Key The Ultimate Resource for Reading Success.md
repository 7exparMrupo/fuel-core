- Reading 1 and Reading 2: These sections present two authentic texts on related topics, with different genres and perspectives.
- Reading Comprehension: This section tests the main idea, supporting details, inference, and critical thinking skills of the readers.
- Vocabulary Building: This section helps readers learn new words and phrases from the texts, using context clues, word parts, synonyms, antonyms, and collocations.
- Reading Faster: This section trains readers to improve their reading speed and fluency.
- Putting It All Together: This section integrates the skills and knowledge from the unit into a final task, such as writing, speaking, or research.

- For teachers: The answer key can be used to prepare lessons, grade assignments, and give feedback to students. Teachers can also use the answer key to create additional exercises or quizzes based on the texts and vocabulary. However, teachers should not rely solely on the answer key to assess students' comprehension and skills. Teachers should also use other methods, such as observation, discussion, or alternative tasks, to evaluate students' performance and progress.
- For students: The answer key can be used to check answers, review mistakes, and learn from feedback. Students can also use the answer key to self-test their comprehension and vocabulary before or after reading the texts. However, students should not use the answer key as a shortcut or a crutch. Students should not look at the answer key before attempting the exercises or quizzes. Students should also not copy or memorize the answers without understanding them. Students should use the answer key as a guide, not as a goal.

## How to Avoid Common Pitfalls
 
The answer key can be a helpful resource, but it can also lead to some problems if used incorrectly or excessively. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid when using the answer key:

- Relying on recognition rather than recall: Recognition is when you recognize something as familiar or correct when you see it. Recall is when you remember something without any cues or hints. Recognition is easier than recall, but it does not mean that you have learned or understood something. When using the answer key, you should try to recall the answers before looking at them. If you only rely on recognition, you may not be able to remember or apply what you have learned in different situations.
- Focusing on quantity rather than quality: Quantity is how much you read or do. Quality is how well you read or do something. Quantity is important, but it is not enough. You also need quality to improve your reading comprehension and vocabulary skills. When using the answer key, you should not focus on how many exercises or quizzes you complete or how many answers you get right. You should also focus on how well you understand the texts and words, how deeply you think about them, and how effectively you use them.
- Ignoring feedback or making excuses: Feedback is information that tells 8cf37b1e13
