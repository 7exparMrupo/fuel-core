### Global
 
The Global section allows you to change some general settings for your controller, such as:
 
- MIDI Channel: This determines which MIDI channel your controller will send and receive data on. You can choose any channel from 1 to 16.
- Velocity Curve: This determines how sensitive your controller's keys and pads are to your touch. You can choose from five different curves: Linear, Logarithmic, Exponential, S-Curve, or Fixed.

- Octave: This allows you to shift the pitch of your controller's keys up or down by octaves. You can choose any value from -4 to +4.
