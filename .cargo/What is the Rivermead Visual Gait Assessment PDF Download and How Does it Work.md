Gait is an important aspect of human mobility and function, especially for patients with neurological disorders such as stroke, brain injury, multiple sclerosis or movement disorders. Gait impairments can affect the quality of life, independence and safety of these patients. Therefore, assessing gait is essential for diagnosis, prognosis and intervention planning.
 
However, gait assessment can be challenging in clinical settings, due to the lack of standardized methods, equipment and expertise. Some gait measures require sophisticated instruments such as motion analysis systems, force platforms or electromyography, which are expensive, time-consuming and not widely available. Other gait measures rely on subjective observations or self-reports, which can be influenced by bias, variability and recall problems.

One possible solution is to use a simple and objective tool that can capture the main features of gait in a reliable and valid way. The Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment (RVGA) is a one such tool that was developed by Lord et al. in 1998[^2^]. The RVGA is based on visual observation of 15 gait components, such as foot clearance, step symmetry, trunk rotation and arm swing. Each component is scored as normal (0), mildly abnormal (1) or severely abnormal (2), resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating worse gait quality.

The RVGA has several advantages over other gait measures. It is easy to administer and score, requiring only a stopwatch and a scoring sheet. It can be performed in any environment where the patient can walk at least 10 meters. It does not require any special equipment or training. It has been shown to have good reliability and validity in various neurological populations, such as stroke[^3^], brain injury, multiple sclerosis and movement disorders. It can also detect changes in gait over time and after interventions .
 
The RVGA is a useful tool for clinicians and researchers who want to assess gait in neurological patients in a quick and objective way. It can provide valuable information on the type and severity of gait deviations, as well as the functional implications and potential treatment goals. The RVGA can also be used as an outcome measure to evaluate the effectiveness of gait interventions.

Here are some examples of how to use the RVGA in clinical practice:
 
- For a patient with stroke who has hemiparesis and spasticity, the RVGA can help identify the specific gait components that are affected, such as foot drop, knee hyperextension, hip hiking and reduced arm swing. The RVGA score can also indicate the severity of the gait impairment and the risk of falls. Based on the RVGA results, the clinician can design a tailored gait intervention that targets the patient's needs and goals, such as using an ankle-foot orthosis, performing stretching exercises, practicing functional tasks or applying electrical stimulation.
- For a patient with brain injury who has cognitive and behavioral problems, the RVGA can help assess the patient's attention, memory and executive function during gait. For example, the clinician can ask the patient to walk while performing a dual task, such as counting backwards or naming animals. The RVGA score can reflect the patient's ability to divide attention and prioritize information while walking. Based on the RVGA results, the clinician can provide feedback and strategies to improve the patient's gait performance and safety, such as using cues, reminders or incentives.
- For a patient with multiple sclerosis who has fatigue and balance problems, the RVGA can help evaluate the patient's endurance and stability during gait. For example, the clinician can ask the patient to walk for a longer distance or on different surfaces. The RVGA score can indicate the patient's level of fatigue and balance control while walking. Based on the RVGA results, the clinician can prescribe appropriate gait interventions that address the patient's limitations and preferences, such as using assistive devices, modifying activity levels or participating in exercise programs.
- For a patient with movement disorders who has involuntary movements and rigidity, the RVGA can help measure the patient's gait quality and variability. For example, the clinician can ask the patient to walk at different speeds or with different rhythms. The RVGA score can capture the patient's gait deviations and fluctuations while walking. Based on the RVGA results, the clinician can adjust the patient's medication dosage or timing, or recommend other gait interventions that may reduce symptoms and improve function, such as using music, biofeedback or deep brain stimulation.

In conclusion, the RVGA is a practical and reliable tool that can assess gait in neurological patients in a comprehensive and objective way. It can provide useful information for diagnosis, prognosis and intervention planning. It can also be used as an outcome measure to evaluate gait changes over time and after interventions.
