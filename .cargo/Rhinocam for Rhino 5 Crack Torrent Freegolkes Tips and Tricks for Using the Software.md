Collaboration For Revit 2012 is a software that allows project teams to work on shared building information models with centralized access to BIM project data in the cloud. It also integrates with Autodesk Revit and Autodesk Buzzsaw to improve communication and markup workflow. One of the problems that users may encounter with this software is the dt07.img fix for pes 2013 skidrow. This is a package that contains a fix to MAWSE3 for the data from the Thermo LTQ-FT Ultra LC mass spectrometer. It includes the new search (version 3.2) and the example data file (lid\_500\_4.txt) as well as NIST MS/MS data files (lid\_00003.txt). This fix may be needed if the user experiences corrupted resources, configuration files, drivers or installation, or malware or virus infection. To apply this fix, the user needs to download the package from a reliable source and replace the dt07.img file in the folder "img" in the game PES 2013 folder.
  
The Thermo LTQ-FT Ultra LC mass spectrometer is a device that can measure the mass and structure of molecules with high accuracy and resolution. It combines two types of mass analyzers: a linear ion trap (LTQ) and a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR). The LTQ can perform multiple stages of fragmentation (MSn) to break down complex molecules into smaller pieces and identify them by their mass-to-charge ratio. The FTICR can detect very small differences in mass with ultra high resolution and accuracy, as well as perform electron capture dissociation (ECD) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) to obtain structural information from intact proteins and peptides. The LTQ-FT Ultra can also switch polarity between positive and negative ions in less than 100 milliseconds, allowing for the analysis of unknown compounds with different charge states.

The LTQ-FT Ultra is suitable for various applications that require high sensitivity, accuracy and resolution, such as proteomics, metabolomics, environmental analysis, petroleum analysis and forensic analysis. For example, in proteomics, the LTQ-FT Ultra can identify proteins and peptides from complex mixtures, quantify their relative abundance, characterize their post-translational modifications (PTMs) and determine their interactions with other molecules. In metabolomics, the LTQ-FT Ultra can profile the metabolites in biological samples, identify unknown compounds, elucidate their structures and pathways, and monitor their changes under different conditions. In environmental analysis, the LTQ-FT Ultra can detect trace levels of pollutants, pesticides, drugs and toxins in water, soil and air samples, as well as determine their origin and fate. In petroleum analysis, the LTQ-FT Ultra can analyze crude oil and its fractions, identify the molecular composition and structure of hydrocarbons, and assess the quality and value of petroleum products. In forensic analysis, the LTQ-FT Ultra can identify drugs, explosives, poisons and other substances in crime scene evidence, as well as provide information on their sources and synthesis.
  
The LTQ-FT Ultra has several features that make it easy to use and maintain. It has a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source that provides enhanced sensitivity and ruggedness for various types of samples. It has a sweep gas feature that reduces chemical noise and improves signal-to-noise ratio. It has an interchangeable ion probe orientation that allows for optimal ionization efficiency. It has a removable metal ion capillary tube that enables vent-free maintenance. It has an advanced ion guide system that ensures high stability and ion transmission efficiency. It has a regulated helium flow that provides consistent performance. It has an automatic system calibration that simplifies the operation. It has a patented dual conversion dynode detector that offers extended dynamic range. It has a digital electronic noise discrimination that improves data quality. It has an open cylindrical ICR Ultra cell that produces higher sensitivity and resolution than conventional cells. It has an actively shielded 7 Tesla superconducting magnet that provides high magnetic field stability. It has ultra low noise detect amplifiers that enhance signal detection. It has ultra fast real-time data acquisition and instrument control system that enables parallel detection of MSn spectra.
