If you are a flight simulator enthusiast who wants to use Prosim 737 for a realistic Boeing 737 cockpit experience, you might wonder how to install and configure it. In this article, we will give you a brief overview of the steps involved in setting up Prosim 737 on your computer or network.
 
## Step 1: Purchase a license
 
To use Prosim 737, you need to purchase a license from their website: https://prosim-ar.com/shop/products/pros...se-v2.html. The license costs â¬699 for home use or â¬1999 for commercial use. You can also download a free trial version that has some limitations: http://download.prosim-ar.com/ProSim737/...-v2.06.zip.
 
## Step 2: Download and extract Prosim
 
Once you have purchased a license, you can download the Prosim software from their website: https://prosim-ar.com/download/. You will need to unzip the files into separate folders on your computer or network. Prosim consists of several modules that can be installed on different computers in a network. The main module is the Prosim 737 server, which connects to Flight Simulator via FSUIPC and communicates with all the other modules. The other modules are:
 
- Prosim Display: This module shows the primary flight display (PFD), navigation display (ND), engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS), and standby instruments on separate monitors.
- Prosim MCP: This module controls the mode control panel (MCP), which is used to set the autopilot and flight director modes and parameters.
- Prosim CDU: This module controls the control display unit (CDU), which is used to program the flight management system (FMS) and navigate along the flight plan.
- Prosim Audio: This module provides realistic sounds for the cockpit environment, such as warnings, alerts, switches, clicks, etc.
- Prosim IO: This module interfaces with various input/output devices, such as switches, buttons, knobs, LEDs, gauges, etc. It supports a wide range of hardware from different manufacturers, such as Open Cockpits, Phidgets, Flight Deck Solutions, CP Flight, Sismo, Flight Illusion, FlyEngravity, FSBus, Joystick cards, etc.

## Step 3: Activate and update Prosim
 
After extracting the Prosim software, you need to activate it with your license key. You can do this by running the Prosim 737 server module and entering your license key in the activation window. You also need to accept the terms and conditions of use. Once activated, you can update Prosim to the latest version by clicking on the update button in the main window. You can choose between stable releases or pre-releases depending on your preference. You can also manually update Prosim by downloading the latest zip files from their website and replacing the old files with them.
 
## Step 4: Configure network settings (for multiple PCs)
 
If you are running Prosim on multiple computers across a network, you need to configure some network settings to make sure they can communicate with each other. You need to assign each computer a name and a static IP address that is unique in your network. You also need to make sure that your firewall and router settings allow TCP/IP communication between your computers on certain ports. You can find more details on how to do this in their wiki page: https://wiki.prosim-ar.com/index.php/Getting\_Started#Network\_Settings\_.28for\_Multiple\_PCs.29.
