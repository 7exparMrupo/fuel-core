If your computer meets the system requirements, you can try these troubleshooting steps to fix the Ail Set Sample Volume Pan 12 error:

1. Run Call of Duty as an administrator. Sometimes, running a game as an administrator can solve compatibility issues and grant access to necessary files.

You can also enable this option permanently by right-clicking on the file, selecting "Properties", clicking on the "Compatibility" tab, and checking the box next to "Run this program as an administrator".

    - On the "General" tab, select "Selective startup" and uncheck the box next to "Load startup items".
    - On the "Services" tab, check the box next to "Hide all Microsoft services" and click on "Disable all".
    - Click on "OK" and restart your computer.
3. Copy the mss32.dll file from the game installation disc. If you have installed Call of Duty from a physical disc, you can copy the mss32.dll file from there and paste it into your game folder. To do this, follow these steps:
