If you want to play arcade games with MAME 2003-Plus, you need to download the full non-merged romset from the Internet Archive[^1^]. This romset contains all the files needed to run each game, including any ROMs from parent or BIOS sets. You can use a torrent client to download the romset faster and more efficiently.
 
Once you have downloaded the romset, you need to extract it to a folder on your device. You can use a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR to do this. You should see a lot of .zip files in the folder, each one representing a game.

To play these games, you need to find or build MAME 2003-Plus romsets using a DAT file and a source of ROMs. You can use a program like ClrMamePro or RomCenter to do this. You can also use the MAME Menu to generate an XML DAT file from the core itself.
 
MAME 2003-Plus also supports CHDs for some games that require them, such as Area 51, Killer Instinct, NFL Blitz, and Primal Rage. You need to download the CHD files separately and place them in subfolders within your romset folder. For example, if you have area51.zip in your romset folder, you need to create a subfolder called area51 and place area51.chd inside it.
